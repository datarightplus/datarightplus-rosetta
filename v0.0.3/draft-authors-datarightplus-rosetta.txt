1.  Scope

   The scope of this document is limited to the conversion of terms
   utilised within the DataRight Plus specification suite to
   jurisdictional terms within legal frameworks.  The intent of
   delivering this document is to remove ambiguity from the broader
   specification set by isolating, generally legal, terms within a
   single document.

2.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Consumer  A Consumer represents an individual or a business for which
      a User has been granted permissions to perform actions on behalf
      of.
   Ecosystem Authority  The Ecosystem Authority represents the
      designated arbiter of trust between Providers, Initiators and the
      Consumer.  Further elaboration on the Ecosystem Authority is
      provided within [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL].
   Electricity Authority  The Electricity Authority represents the
      holder of information pertaining to electricity meters and usage.
   Initiator  A Initiator is a client application which conducts
      activities with a Provider server.  In an authorisation context a
      Initiator is analogous with an [OIDC-Core] Relying Party (RP).
   Initiator Brand  TODO
   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  Information that (a) can
      be used to identify the natural person to whom such information
      relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a
      natural person to whom such information relates.
   Provider  A Provider is a piece of server infrastructure which
      receives requests from an Initiator.  In an authorisation context
      a Provider is analogous with an [OIDC-Core] OpenID Provider (OP).
   User  A User is a human who provides an identifier unique to the
      individual and for which correlates to one or more Consumer
      relationships.  In an authorisation context a User is analogous
      with an [OIDC-Core] End-User.

3.1.  Australian Consumer Data Right

3.1.1.  CDR Consumer

   A CDR Consumer is a business or individual who authorises the sharing
   of data stored by a CDR Data Holder on their behalf to a CDR Software
   Product with their permission.  A User, regardless of their
   individual relationship with a Data Holder may also have access to
   zero or more non-individual Consumer's, for instance businesses that
   they have permission to make decisions for.

   It is critical to note that a CDR Consumer is the individual entity
   of which data is being shared or actions are being performed on.
   Within the CDR there are various relationship types including:

   *  Nominated Representatives: Authorised representatives of a
      specific corporate entity, for instance a company director
   *  Secondary Users: Authorised parties who can access an individual
      Consumers data

3.1.2.  Data Holder Brand

   For the purposes of this specification a Data Holder is described as
   the party who is offering or has offered services to the Consumer
   and/or holds relevant data related to those services on behalf of the
   Consumer.

   The types and format of that data is outside the scope of this
   particular specification but traditionally includes:

   *  specific customer information such as name, addresses and phone
      numbers;
   *  information related to services such as account numbers, pricing
      information and balances;
   *  transaction/ledger information pertaining to services provided

   Within the CDR ecosystem the mandated Data Holders are ostensible
   Banking and Energy providers.  Additional sectors can be designated
   by way of a legally binding Designation Instrument coupled with
   changes to the CDR Rules.

3.1.3.  Legal Entity

3.1.4.  Data Recipient

   A CDR Data Recipient is a party that provides activities, such as
   data sharing, through the Consumer who participates in the
   authorisation process initiated by a Initiator.  Please refer to the
   expanded description of Provider within this document.

3.1.5.  Software Product

   A Software Product is the listed value proposition, provided by a
   Data Recipient, which accesses a Data Holder Brand.

3.1.6.  CDR Register
