1.  Scope

   The scope of this document is limited to the conversion of terms
   utilised within the DataRight Plus specification suite to
   jurisdictional terms within legal frameworks.  The intent of
   delivering this document is to remove ambiguity from the broader
   specification set by isolating, generally legal, terms within a
   single document.

2.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Action Identifier  A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) which
      references a specific action requested by an Initiator to a
      Provider
   Agreement Identifier  A reference to a DataRight+ agreement
      identifier.  Refer to the relevant DataRight+ profile for
      supported agreement types.
   Arrangement Identifier  A reference to a CDR related arrangement
      identifier, currently only CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier is
      supported within the CDR ecosystem.
   Banking Sector  Relates to the Holders, designated under the
      [CDR-RULES] in the Banking industry
   Certificate Practice Statement  A statement of the practices that a
      certification authority (CA) employs in issuing, suspending,
      revoking, and renewing certificates and providing access to them,
      in accordance with specific requirements.
   CDR  Consumer Data Right
   CDR Sharing Arrangement  A legal construct, established by the
      [CDR-RULES] representing a disclosure consent between a Provider
      and a Initiator via a Software Product.
   CDR Sharing Arrangement Identifier  A unique and persistent
      identifier, typically a UUID or similar, that represents a
      reference to a CDR Sharing Arrangement.
   Consumer  A Consumer represents an individual or an entity for which
      a User has been granted permissions to perform actions on behalf
      of.
   Data Set Language  When requesting consent to conduct actions a
      Provider must present a description of the action or data being
      permitted.  The Data Set Language is a prescription of what this
      text MUST be.
   Designated Holders  Designated Holders are organisations which belong
      to a designated sector, according to the [CDR-RULES] and meet
      certain eligibility requirements to be required to deliver CDR
      services within their sector.
   Ecosystem Authority  The Ecosystem Authority represents the
      designated arbiter of trust between Providers, Initiators and the
      Consumer.  Further elaboration on the Ecosystem Authority is
      provided within [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL].
   Electricity Authority  The Electricity Authority represents the
      holder of information pertaining to electricity meters and usage.
   Electricity Plan Website  The Electricity Plan Website represents the
      holder of information pertaining to electricity plan information
   Energy Sector  Relates to the Designated Holders, designated under
      the [CDR-RULES] in the Energy industry
   Initiator  An Initiator is a client application which conducts
      activities with a Provider server.  In an authorisation context a
      Initiator is analogous with an [OIDC-Core] Relying Party (RP).
   Initiator Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (ICARE)  A specific URI for
      the purposes of issuing ICARE requests as described in
      [DATARIGHTPLUS-SHARING-ARRANGEMENT-V1-00].
   Initiator Base URI (IBU)  The Base URI used for all calls to
      Initiator hosted resource server endpoints.
   Non-Functional Requirements  Refers to the performance requirements
      specified within the Non-Functional Requirements section of [CDS]
   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  Information that (a) can
      be used to identify the natural person to whom such information
      relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a
      natural person to whom such information relates.
   Provider  A Provider is a piece of server infrastructure which
      receives requests from an Initiator.  In an authorisation context
      a Provider is analogous with an [OIDC-Core] OpenID Provider (OP).
   User  A User is a human who provides an identifier unique to the
      individual and for which correlates to one or more Consumer
      relationships.  In an authorisation context a User is analogous
      with an [OIDC-Core] End-User.

3.  Action Initiation

   The DataRight+ specifications seek to extend functionality through
   the introduction of a formalised action initiation methodology.  The
   primary intent is to establish a standardised pattern that is not
   purely limited to the sharing mandates of the CDR.  In order to
   achieve these objectives there is a common entity relationship model
   adopted visualised as follows:

   +---------------+ +--------------+ +--------------+ | | | | | | |
   Authorisation |-0:1--> Action +--0:n--> Entity | | | | | | |
   +---------------+ +--------------+ +--------------+

3.1.  Authorisation

   An Authorisation refers to the OAuth2 authorisation associated with
   an Action.

   An authorisation MUST NOT be associated with more than one action.
   It is not currently expected that a single action will support
   multiple authorisations.  To facilitate progressive authorisation a
   new action identifier would be generated to represent each
   progressive authorisation.

   There are circumstances where an Initiator may have already obtained
   access to the required data and therefore an authorisation *MAY NOT*
   be necessary.  A common example of this is where an existing sharing
   agreement already grants access the data requested but the method of
   obtaining this data is changed, for example the action is an
   asynchronous retrieval of transaction data.

3.2.  Action

   Represents a single unit of work to deliver an entity resource
   outcome.  An action alone completes regardless of the outcome being a
   success or failure.  It does not represent a specific outcome or data
   set for the desired outcome but rather a resource of the process
   itself.

3.3.  Entity

   An entity in the Action Initiation context refers to a resource,
   result or handle produced as a result of an action.  In the context
   of a sharing agreement this would be a resource describing the
   agreement itself.  Another example may be an authorised payment
   permission which is then used to initiate the payments themselves.

   Not all actions result in entities however in some cases one action
   may produce multiple entities.  If and how many entities are produced
   is dependent on the individual action in question.

4.  Ecosystem Specific Mappings

   The following table provides a mapping from DataRight+ terminology to
   ecosystem specific terms.

                                  Table 1

4.1.  Australian Consumer Data Right

4.1.1.  Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC)

   The ACCC is the designated government entity empowered by legislation
   to operate as the Ecosystem Authority of the Australian Consumer Data
   Right.

4.1.2.  CDR Consumer

   A CDR Consumer is a business or individual who authorises the sharing
   of data stored by a CDR Data Holder on their behalf to a CDR Software
   Product with their permission.  A User, regardless of their
   individual relationship with a Data Holder may also have access to
   zero or more non-individual Consumer's, for instance businesses that
   they have permission to make decisions for.

   It is critical to note that a CDR Consumer is the individual entity
   of which data is being shared or actions are being performed on.
   Within the CDR there are various relationship types including:

   *  Nominated Representatives: Authorised representatives of a
      specific corporate entity, for instance a company director
   *  Secondary Users: Authorised parties who can access an individual
      Consumers data

4.1.3.  Data Holder Brand

   For the purposes of this specification a Data Holder is described as
   the party who is offering or has offered services to the Consumer
   and/or holds relevant data related to those services on behalf of the
   Consumer.

   The types and format of that data is outside the scope of this
   particular specification but traditionally includes:

   *  specific customer information such as name, addresses and phone
      numbers;
   *  information related to services such as account numbers, pricing
      information and balances;
   *  transaction/ledger information pertaining to services provided

   Within the CDR ecosystem the mandated Data Holders are ostensible
   Banking and Energy providers.  Additional sectors can be designated
   by way of a legally binding Designation Instrument coupled with
   changes to the CDR Rules.

4.1.4.  Legal Entity

   A Legal Entity represents a company, corporation, trust or government
   organisation, as defined by the Australian Corporations Act.

4.1.5.  Data Recipient

   A CDR Data Recipient is a party that provides activities, such as
   data sharing, through the Consumer who participates in the
   authorisation process initiated by a Initiator.  Please refer to the
   expanded description of Provider within this document.

4.1.6.  Software Product

   A Software Product is the listed value proposition, provided by a
   Data Recipient, which accesses a Data Holder Brand.

4.1.7.  CDR Register

   The CDR Register is the technology infrastructure, operated by the
   ACCC delivering the Ecosystem Authority provisions outlined in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
